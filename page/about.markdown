<p>How should I start? My name is Stafford Horne, usually my alias online is shorne, however, when that is not available I use stffrdhrn.  I grew up in Southern California and had a pretty normal life until I graduated high school.  In school I enjoyed math and I was beginning to catch on with these things called PC&#8217;s and programming languages.</p>
<p>I began programming basic when I was around 12 years old.  I remember the first program I wrote was an animation of a truck that drove back and forth across the screen.  In high school I was turned on to linux by some friends of mine but I didn&#8217;t get to far into it until I got my own computer in college.</p>

<p>I attended <a href="https://www.sjsu.edu">San Jose State University</a>, which is in bay area California, for a
BS in Computer Engineering. At university computers and math came natural to me,
and I actually learned assembly and C on my own before I took any of the
classes. As a Computer Engineering student I was never able to conclude which
computer path to take, software or hardware. In school I chose to persue both
software and hardware equally.</p>

<p>After graduating from SJSU I started a job as a software engineer in Fremont
California where I worked on Linux. Soon after being hired I was asked to
transfer to Beijing, China to help with a Chinese startup branch.</p>

<p>I worked as a software engineer for <a href="http://www.surfcontrol.com">SurfControl China</a> in Beijing China for 3
years.</p>

<p>In December of 2006 I moved to Tokyo, Japan to persue a new
career.  I am now working at a Financial Services Company as a software
engineer.  Japan has been kind to me so far, I can't imagine where I will go
next.</p>

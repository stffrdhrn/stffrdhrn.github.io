<h2>Interests</h2>
<h3>Distributed Systems</h3>
<p>I have extensive experience designing and building distributed
systems.  This has ranged form load balancing email servers to financial
transaction processing systems.  Building these systems has included
designing web administration and monitoring platforms as well as developer
tools to make developing, testing and configuring these systems easier.</p>

<p>In finance, systems need to be guaranteed to not lose a single
transaction.  Designing these systems required me to think about how to
recover from failure for every bit of code by using ACID transactions.</p>

<p>Along with designing the robust systems which process millions of
transactions I am interested the user interface to these systems.  I am
interested in and have have experience developing non technical user Web
Applications to allow the configuration of these systems.  I am also
interested in how technical users can monitor and administer the system by
creating meaningful logs, metrics and management interfaces.</p>

<p>I am also interested and have a lot of success in tuning performance
issues and troubleshooting bugs in these distributed systems.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>I have knowledge in both Network and Application level security.  I have
knowledge and experience in securely configuring and designing networks,
network servers, services and firewalls.  I have implemented  scalable
solutions which defend against network attacks at connection level as well
as deal with deep content scanning.</p>

<p>At the application level I am familiar with methods for identifying and
patching security issues. I am familiar with low level software security
issues like <em>Format String</em> and <em>Buffer Overflow</em>
vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Cryptography and the math behind it is also interesting to me. I have
implemented STARTTLS on mail servers and have a deep understanding of
Private/Public key encryption schemes.</p>

<h3>OpenRISC, Linux and Open Source</h3>
<p>As a computer engineer I have a background in both hardware and software
engineering.  As my day job is mainly high level systems programming I keep
my hardware knowledge sharp by contributing to open source projects.</p>

<p>I am currently the Linux kernel maintainer for the OpenRISC
architecture.  My experience working on OpenRISC and the Linux kernel since
2016 has allowed me to work with excellent people and code bases.</p>

<p>As maintainer I have worked to develop, cleanup, review and test Linux
patchsets for the OpenRISC architecture.  This activity has also allowed me
to work on and improve OpenRISC on so many other systems including GDB,
GCC, OpenOCD and QEMU.</p>

<h3>Networking &amp; Administration</h3>
<p>I administer several machine as simply a part of software development
and ensure they all run smoothly  and can synchronise and backup their
settings and other information over a LAN. I write many shell scripts &amp;
C programs  to help with this - as well as know how to configure all the
services on my systems (dhcp, dns, apache, mail, users  etc.)</p>

<h3>Other</h3>
<p>I have hobbies of guitar, rock climbing, skateboarding and coffee. I can speak
Mandarin Chinese conversationally, Japanese conversationally and get by with German.
I enjoy speaking and learning foreign languages, as well as travel.</p>

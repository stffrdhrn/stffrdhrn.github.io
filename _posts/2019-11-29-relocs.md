Recently I have been working on getting the [OpenRISC glibc](https://github.com/openrisc/or1k-glibc)
port ready for upstreaming.  Part of this work has been to run the glibc
testsuite and get the tests to pass.  The [glibc testsuite](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Testing/Testsuite)
has a comprehensive set of linker and runtime relocation tests.

In order to fix issues with tests I had to learn more than I did before about ELF Relocations
, Thread Local Storage and the binutils linker implementation in BFD.  There is a lot of
documentation available, but it's a bit hard to follow as it assumes certain
knowledge, for example have a look at the Solaris [Linker and Libraries](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23824_01/html/819-0690/chapter6-54839.html)
section on relocations.  In this article I will try to fill in those gaps.

This will be an illustrated 3 part series covering
 - ELF Binaries and Relocation Entries
 - [Thread Local Storage]({% post_url 2020-01-19-tls %})
 - [How Relocations and Thread Local Store are Implemented]({% post_url 2020-07-21-relocs_tls_impl %})

All of the examples in this article can be found in my [tls-examples](https://github.com/stffrdhrn/tls-examples)
project.  Please check it out.

On Linux, you can download it and `make` it with your favorite toolchain.
By default it will cross compile using an [openrisc toolchain](https://openrisc.io/software).
This can be overridden with the `CROSS_COMPILE` variable.
For example, to build for your current host.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:stffrdhrn/tls-examples.git
$ make CROSS_COMPILE=
gcc -fpic -c -o tls-gd-dynamic.o tls-gd.c -Wall -O2 -g
gcc -fpic -c -o nontls-dynamic.o nontls.c -Wall -O2 -g
...
objdump -dr x-static.o > x-static.S
objdump -dr xy-static.o > xy-static.S
```

Now we can get started.

## ELF Segments and Sections

Before we can talk about relocations we need to talk a bit about what makes up
[ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) binaries.
This is a prerequisite as relocations and TLS are part of ELF binaries.  There
are a few basic ELF binary types:

 - Objects (`.o`) - produced by a compiler, contains a collection of sections, also call relocatable files.
 - Program - an executable program, contains sections grouped into segments.
 - Shared Objects (`.so`) - a program library, contains sections grouped into segments.
 - Core Files - core dump of program memory, these are also ELF binaries

Here we will discuss Object Files and Program Files.

### An ELF Object

![ELF Object](/content/2019/elf-obj.png)

The compiler generates object files, these contain sections of binary data and
these are not executable.

The object file produced by [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-9.2.0/gcc/Overall-Options.html#index-c)
generally contains `.rela.text`, `.text`, `.data` and `.bss` sections.

 - `.rela.text` - a list of relocations against the `.text` section
 - `.text` - contains compiled program machine code
 - `.data` - static and non static initialized variable values
 - `.bss`  - static and non static non-initialized variables

### An ELF Program

![ELF Program](/content/2019/elf-program.png)

ELF binaries are made of [sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_segment) and segments.

A segment contains a group of sections and the segment defines how the data should
be loaded into memory for program execution.

Each segment is mapped to program memory by the kernel when a process is created.  Program files contain
most of the same sections as objects but there are some differences.

 - `.text` - contains executable program code, there is no `.rela.text` section
 - `.got`  - the [global offset table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Offset_Table) used to access variables, created during link time.  May be populated during runtime.

### Looking at ELF binaries (`readelf`)

The `readelf` tool can help inspect elf binaries.

Some examples:

#### Reading Sections of an Object File

Using the `-S` option we can read sections from an elf file.
As we can see below we have the `.text`, `.rela.text`, `.bss` and many other
sections.

```
$ readelf -S tls-le-static.o
There are 20 section headers, starting at offset 0x604:

Section Headers:
  [Nr] Name              Type            Addr     Off    Size   ES Flg Lk Inf Al

```

#### Reading Sections of a Program File

Using the `-S` option on a program file we can also read the sections.  The file
type does not matter as long as it is an ELF we can read the sections.
As we can see below there is no longer a `rela.text` section, but we have others
including the `.got` section.

```
$ readelf -S tls-le-static
There are 31 section headers, starting at offset 0x32e8fc:

Section Headers:

```

#### Reading Segments from a Program File

Using the `-l` option on a program file we can read the segments.
Notice how segments map from file offsets to memory offsets and alignment.
The two different `LOAD` type segments are segregated by read only/execute and read/write.
Each section is also mapped to a segment here.  As we can see `.text is in the first `LOAD` segment
which is executable as expected.

```
$ readelf -l tls-le-static

Elf file type is EXEC (Executable file)
Entry point 0x2104
There are 5 program headers, starting at offset 52

Program Headers:

```

#### Reading Segments from an Object File

Using the `-l` option with an object file does not work as we can see below.

```
readelf -l tls-le-static.o

There are no program headers in this file.
```

## Relocation entries

As mentioned an object file by itself is not executable.  The main reason is that
there are no program headers as we just saw.  Another reason is that
the `.text` section still contains relocation entries (or placeholders) for the
addresses of variables located in the `.data` and `.bss` sections.
These placeholders will just be `0` in the machine code.  So, if we tried to run
the machine code in an object file we would end up with Segmentation faults ([SEGV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault)).

A relocation entry is a placeholder that is added by the compiler or linker when
producing ELF binaries.
The relocation entries are to be filled in with addresses pointing to data.
Relocation entries can be made in code such as the `.text` section or in data
sections like the `.got` section.  For example:

## Resolving Relocations

![GCC and Linker](/content/2019/gcc-obj-ld.png)

The diagram above shows relocation entries as white circles.
Relocation entries may be filled or resolved at link-time or dynamically during execution.

Link time relocations
  - Place holders are filled in when ELF object files are linked by the linker to create executables or libraries
  - For example, relocation entries in `.text` sections

Dynamic relocations
  - Place holders is filled during runtime by the dynamic linker.  i.e. Procedure Link Table
  - For example, relocation entries added to `.got` and `.plt` sections which link
    to shared objects.

*Note: Statically built binaries do not have any dynamic relocations and are not
loaded with the dynamic linker.*

In general link time relocations are used to fill in relocation entries in code.
Dynamic relocations fill in relocation entries in data sections.

### Listing Relocation Entries

A list of relocations in a ELF binary can printed using `readelf` with
the `-r` options.

Output of `readelf -r tls-gd-dynamic.o`

```
Relocation section '.rela.text' at offset 0x530 contains 10 entries:
 Offset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name + Addend
00000000  00000f16 R_OR1K_TLS_GD_HI1 00000000   x + 0
00000008  00000f17 R_OR1K_TLS_GD_LO1 00000000   x + 0
00000020  0000100c R_OR1K_GOTPC_HI16 00000000   _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ - 4
00000024  0000100d R_OR1K_GOTPC_LO16 00000000   _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ + 0
0000002c  00000d0f R_OR1K_PLT26      00000000   __tls_get_addr + 0
...
```

The relocation entry list explains how to and where to apply the relocation entry.
It contains:
 - `Offset` - the location in the binary that needs to be updated
 - `Info` - the encoded value containing the `Type, Sym and Addend`, which is
     broken down to:
   - `Type` - the type of relocation (the formula for what is to be performed is defined in the
     linker)
   - `Sym. Value` - the address value (if known) of the symbol.
   - `Sym. Name` - the name of the symbol (variable name) that this relocation needs to find
     during link time.
 - `Addend` - a value that needs to be added to the derived symbol address.
   This is used to with arrays (i.e. for a relocation referencing `a[14]` we would have **Sym. Name** `a` and an **Addend** of the data size of `a` times `14`)

### Example

File: [nontls.c](https://github.com/stffrdhrn/tls-examples/blob/master/nontls.c)

In the example below we have a simple variable and a function to access it's
address.

```c
static int x;

int* get_x_addr() {
  return &x;
}
```

Let's see what happens when we compile this source.

*The steps to compile and link can be found in the [tls-examples](https://github.com/stffrdhrn/tls-examples) project hosting
the source examples.*


### Before Linking

![Non TLS Object](/content/2019/nontls-obj.png)

The diagram above shows relocations in the resulting object file as white circles.

In the actual output below we can see that access to the variable `x` is
referenced by a literal `0` in each instruction.  These are highlighted with
square brackets `[]` below for clarity.

These empty parts of the `.text` section are relocation entries.

```
Addr.   Machine Code    Assembly             Relocations
0000000c <get_x_addr>:
   c:   19 60 [00 00]   l.movhi r11,[0]      # c  R_OR1K_AHI16 .bss
  10:   44 00  48 00    l.jr r9
  14:   9d 6b [00 00]    l.addi r11,r11,[0]  # 14 R_OR1K_LO_16_IN_INSN        .bss
```

The function `get_x_addr` will return the address of variable `x`.
We can look at the assembly instruction to understand how this is done.  Some background
of the OpenRISC ABI.

 - Registers are 32-bit.
 - Function return values are placed in register `r11`.
 - To return from a function we jump to the address in the link register `r9`.
 - OpenRISC has a [branch delay slot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay_slot), meaning the address after a branch it executed
   before the branch is taken.

Now, lets break down the assembly:

 - `l.movhi` - move the value `[0]` into high bits of register `r11`, clearing the lower bits.
 - `l.addi` - add the value in register `r11` to the value `[0]` and store the results in `r11`.
 - `l.jr` - jump to the address in `r9`

This constructs a 32-bit value out of 2 16-bit values.

### After Linking

![Non TLS Object](/content/2019/nontls-exe.png)

The diagram above shows the relocations have been replaced with actual values.

As we can see from the linker output the places in the machine code that had relocation place holders
are now replaced with values.  For example `1a 20 00 00` has become `1a 20 00 0a`.

```
00002298 <get_x_addr>:
    2298:	19 60 00 0a 	l.movhi r11,0xa
    229c:	44 00 48 00 	l.jr r9
    22a0:	9d 6b ee 60 	l.addi r11,r11,-4512
```

If we calculate `0xa << 16 + -4512 (fee60)` we see get `0009ee60`.  That is the
same location of `x` within our binary.  This we can check with `readelf -s`
which lists all symbols.

```
$ readelf -s nontls-static | grep ' x'
    42: 0009ee60     4 OBJECT  LOCAL  DEFAULT   17 x
```

## Types of Relocations

As we saw above, a simple program resulted in 2 different relocation entries just to compose the address of 1 variable.
We saw:

  - `R_OR1K_AHI16`
  - `R_OR1K_LO_16_IN_INSN`

The need for different relacation types comes from the different requirements for the
relocation.  Processing of a relocation involves usually a very simple transform
, each relocation defines a different transform.  The components of the relocation
definition are:

  - **Input** The input of a relocation formula is always the **Symbol Address** who's absolute value is unknown at compile time. But
    there may also be other input variables to the formula including:
      - **Program Counter** The absolute address of the machine code address being updated
      - **Addend** The addend from the relocation entry discussed above in the *Listing Relocation Entries* section
  - **Formula** How the input is manipulated to derive the output value.  For example shift right 16 bits.
  - **Bit-Field** Specifies which bits at the output address need to be updated.

To be more specific about the above relocations we have:

|Relocation Type|Bit-Field|Formula|
|---------------|---------|-------|
|`R_OR1K_AHI16`|`simm16`|`S >> 16`|
|`R_OR1K_LO_16_IN_INSN`|`simm16`|`S && 0xffff`|

The Bit-Field described above is `simm16` which means update the lower 16-bits
of the 32-bit value at the output offset and do not disturb the upper 16-bits.

```
 +----------+----------+
 |          |  simm16  |
 | 31    16 | 15     0 |
 +----------+----------+
```

There are many other Relocation Types with difference Bit-Fields and Formulas.
These use different methods based on what each instruction does, and where each instruction
encodes its immediate value.

For full listings refer to architecture manuals.

## Summary

In this article we have discussed what ELF binaries are and how they can be read.
We have talked about how from compilation to linking to runtime, relocation entries
are used to communicate which parts of a program remain to be resolved.  We
then discussed how relocation types provide a formula and bit-mask for updating
the places in ELF binaries that need to be filled in.

In the next article we will discuss how Thread Local Storage works, both link-time
and runtime relocation entries play big part in how TLS works.

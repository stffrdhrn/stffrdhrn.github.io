In the [last article]({% post_url 2023-04-25-or1k-fpu-port %}) we introduced the
OpenRISC glibc FPU port and the effort required to get user space FPU support
into OpenRISC linux user applications.  We explained how the FPU port is a
fullstack project covering:

 - Architecture Specification
 - Simulators and CPU implementations
 - Linux Kernel support
 - GCC Instructions and Soft FPU
 - Binutils/GDB Debugging Support
 - glibc support

In this entry we will cover updating *Simulators and CPU implementations* to support
the architecture changes which are called for as per the previous article.

 - Allowing usermode programs to update the FPCSR register
 - Detecting tininess before rounding

# Simulator Updates

The simulators used for testing OpenRISC software without hardware are QEMU
and or1ksim.  They both needed to be updated to cohere to the specification
updates discussed above.

## Or1ksim Updates

The OpenRISC architectue simulator or1ksim has been updated with the single patch:
[cpu: Allow FPCSR to be read/written in user mode](https://github.com/openrisc/or1ksim/commit/7a03376c1bd0fc0d5008d3222c623601e7080b43).

The softfloat FPU implementation was already configured to detect tininess before
rounding.

If you are interested you can download and run the simulator and test this out
with a docker image pulled from docker hub using the following:

```bash
# using podman instead of docker, you can use docker here too
podman pull stffrdhrn/or1k-sim-env:latest
podman run -it --rm stffrdhrn/or1k-sim-env:latest

root@9a4a52eec8ee:/tmp# or1k-elf-sim -version
Seeding random generator with value 0x4a3c2bbd
OpenRISC 1000 Architectural Simulator, version 2023-08-20
```

This starts up an environment which has access to the OpenRISC architecture
simulator and a GNU compiler toolchain.  While still in the container can run a
quick test using the FPU as follows:

```bash
# Create a test program using OpenRISC FPU
cat > fpee.c <<EOF
#include <float.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <or1k-sprs.h>
#include <or1k-support.h>

static void enter_user_mode() {
  int32_t sr = or1k_mfspr(OR1K_SPR_SYS_SR_ADDR);
  sr &= ~OR1K_SPR_SYS_SR_SM_MASK;
  or1k_mtspr(OR1K_SPR_SYS_SR_ADDR, sr);
}
static void enable_fpu_exceptions() {
  unsigned long fpcsr = OR1K_SPR_SYS_FPCSR_FPEE_MASK;
  or1k_mtspr(OR1K_SPR_SYS_FPCSR_ADDR, fpcsr);
}
static void fpe_handler() {
  printf("Got FPU Exception, PC: 0x%lx\n", or1k_mfspr(OR1K_SPR_SYS_EPCR_BASE));
}
int main() {
  float result;

  or1k_exception_handler_add(0xd, fpe_handler);
#ifdef USER_MODE
  /* Note, printf here also allocates some memory allowing user mode runtime to
     work.  */
  printf("Enabling user mode\n");
  enter_user_mode();
#endif
  enable_fpu_exceptions();

  printf("Exceptions enabled, now DIV 3.14 / 0!\n");
  result = 3.14f / 0.0f;

  /* Verify we see infinity.  */
  printf("Result: %f\n", result);
  /* Verify we see DZF set.  */
  printf("FPCSR: %x\n", or1k_mfspr(OR1K_SPR_SYS_FPCSR_ADDR));

#ifdef USER_MODE
  asm volatile("l.movhi r3, 0; l.nop 1"); /* Exit sim, now */
#endif
  return 0;
}
EOF

```

In the above we can see how to compile and run a simple FPU test program and run
it on or1ksim.  The program set's up an FPU exception handler, enables exceptions
then does a divide by zero to produce an exception. This program uses the
OpenRISC [newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/) (baremetal) toolchain to
compile a program that can run directly on the simulator, as oppposed to a
program running in an OS on a simulator or hardware.

Note, that normally *newlib* programs expect to run in supervisor mode, when
our program switches to user mode we need to take some precautions to ensure it
can run correctly.  As noted in the comments, usually when allocating and exiting
the *newlib* runtime will do things like disabling/enabling interrupts which
will fail when running in user mode.

## QEMU Updates

The QEMU update was done in my
[OpenRISC user space FPCSR](https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20230511151000.381911-1-shorne@gmail.com)
qemu patch series.  The series was merged for the
[qemu 8.1](https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/8.1) release.

The updates were split it into three changes:
 - Allowing FPCSR access in user mode.
 - Properly set the exception PC address on floating point exceptions.
 - Configuring the QEMU softfloat implementation to perform tininess check
   before rounding.

### QEMU Patch 1

The first patch to *allow FPCSR access in user mode* was trivial, but required some
code structure changes making the patch look bigger than it really was.

### QEMU Patch 2

The next patch to *properly set the exception PC address* fixed a long existing
bug where the `EPCR` was not properly updated after FPU exceptions.  Up until now
OpenRISC userspace did not support FPU instructions and this code path had not
been tested.

To explain why this fix is important let us look at the `EPCR` and what it is used for
in a bit more detail.
In general, when an exception occurs an OpenRISC CPU will store the program counter (`PC`)
of the instruction that caused the exception into the exeption program counter address
(`EPCR`).  Floating point exceptions are a special case in that the `EPCR` is
actually set to the next instruction to be executed, this is to avoid looping.

When the linux kernel handles a floating point exception it follows the path
[0xd00][1] > [fpe_trap_handler][2] > [ do_fpe_trap][3].  This will setup a
[signal][4] to be delivered to the user process.
The Linux OS uses the `EPCR` to report the exception instruction address to
userspace via a `signal` which we can see being done in `do_fpe_trap` which
we can see below:

```c
asmlinkage void do_fpe_trap(struct pt_regs *regs, unsigned long address)
{
	int code = FPE_FLTUNK;
	unsigned long fpcsr = regs->fpcsr;

	if (fpcsr & SPR_FPCSR_IVF)
		code = FPE_FLTINV;
	else if (fpcsr & SPR_FPCSR_OVF)
		code = FPE_FLTOVF;
	else if (fpcsr & SPR_FPCSR_UNF)
		code = FPE_FLTUND;
	else if (fpcsr & SPR_FPCSR_DZF)
		code = FPE_FLTDIV;
	else if (fpcsr & SPR_FPCSR_IXF)
		code = FPE_FLTRES;

	/* Clear all flags */
	regs->fpcsr &= ~SPR_FPCSR_ALLF;

	force_sig_fault(SIGFPE, code, (void __user *)regs->pc);
}
```

Here we see the excption becomes a `SIGFPE` signal and the exception address in
`regs->pc` is passed to [force_sig_fault][10].  The `PC` will be used to set the
`si_addr` field of the `siginfo_t` structure.

Next upon return from kernel space to user space the path is `do_fpe_trap` >
`_fpe_trap_handler` > [ret_from_exception][5] > [resume_userspace][6] >
[work_pending][7] > [do_work_pending][8] > [restore_all][9].

Inside of `do_work_pending` with there the signal handling is done.  In explain a bit
about this in the article [Unwinding a Bug - How C++ Exceptions Work]({% post_url 2020-12-13-cxx-exception-unwinding %}).
In `restore_all` we see `EPCR` is returned to when exception handling is
complete. A snipped of this code is show below:

```

    l.lwz   r23,PT_GPR23(r1)                    ;\
    l.lwz   r24,PT_GPR24(r1)                    ;\
    l.lwz   r25,PT_GPR25(r1)                    ;\
    l.lwz   r26,PT_GPR26(r1)                    ;\
    l.lwz   r27,PT_GPR27(r1)                    ;\
    l.lwz   r28,PT_GPR28(r1)                    ;\

    l.lwz   r1,PT_SP(r1)                    ;\
    l.rfe
```

Here we can see how `l.mtspr r0,r3,SPR_EPCR_BASE` restores the `EPCR` to the pc
address stored in `pt_regs` when we entered the exception handler.  All
other register are restored and finally the `l.rfe` instruction is issued to
return from the exception which affectively jumps to `EPCR`.

The reason QEMU was not setting the correct exception address is due to the way
qemu is implemented which optimizes performance.  QEMU executes target code
basic blocks that are translated to host native instructions, during runtime
all `PC` addresses are those of the host, for example x86-64 64-bit
addresses.  When an exception occurs, updating the target `PC` address from the host `PC`
need to be explicityly requested.


### QEMU Patch 3

The next patch to implement *tininess before rouding* was also trivial but
brought up a conversation about default NaN payloads.

### QEMU Patch 4

Wait, there is more.  During writing this article I realized that if QEMU
was setting the `ECPR` to the FPU instruction causing the exception then
we would end up in an endless loop.

Luckily the arcitecture anticipated this calling for FPU exceptions to set the next
instruction to be executed to `EPCR`.  QEMU was missing this logic.

The patch [target/openrisc: Set EPCR to next PC on FPE exceptions](https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20230731210301.3360723-1-shorne@gmail.com/)
fixes this up.

# RTL Updates

Updating the actual verilog RTL CPU implementations also needed to be done.
Updates have been made to both the [mor1kx](https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx)
and the
[or1k_marocchino](https://github.com/openrisc/or1k_marocchino/tree/master)
implementations.

## mor1kx Updates

Updates to the *mor1kx* to support user mode reads and write to the `FPCSR` were done in the patch:
[Make FPCSR is R/W accessible for both user- and supervisor- modes](https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx/commit/6b1beaa871c02ccd570d8e6ad80f99bc4133aa26).

The full patch is:

```patch

          else if ((spr_we & spr_access[`OR1K_SPR_SYS_BASE] &
-                  (spr_sr[`OR1K_SPR_SR_SM] & padv_ctrl | du_access)) &&

           `ifdef OR1K_FPCSR_MASK_FLAGS
```

The change to verilog shows that before when writng (`spr_we`) to the FPCSR (`OR1K_SPR_FPCSR_ADDR`) register
we used to check that the supervisor bit (`OR1K_SPR_SR_SM`) bit of the sr spr (`spr_sr`) is set.  That check
enforced supervisor mode only write access, removing this allows user space to write to the regsiter.

Updating *mor1kx* to support tininess checking before rounding was done in the
change [Refactoring and implementation tininess detection before
rounding](https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx/commit/f2a78cc5d98123e63af4b23296795d95ffdfd854).
I will not go into the details of these patches as I don't understand them so
much.

## Marocchino Updates

Updates to the *or1k_marocchino* to support user mode reads and write to the `FPCSR` were done in the patch:
[Make FPCSR is R/W accessible for both user- and supervisor- modes](https://github.com/openrisc/or1k_marocchino/commit/cd9e2bd977f489892ea632142078e4bca8976576).

Updating the *marocchino* to support dttectig tininess before rounding was done in the
patch:

I will not go into details of the patch as I didn't write them.  In
general it is a medium size refactoring of the floating point unit.

# Summary

We discussed updates to the architecture simulators and verilog CPU implementations
to allow supporting user mode floating point programs.  These updates will now allow us to
port Linux and glibc to the OpenRISC floating point unit.

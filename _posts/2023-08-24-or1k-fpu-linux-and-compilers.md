In this series we introduced the OpenRISC glibc FPU port and the effort required
to get user space FPU support into OpenRISC linux user applications.  We
explained how the FPU port is a fullstack project covering:

 - [Architecture Specification]({% post_url 2023-04-25-or1k-fpu-port %})
 - [Simulators and CPU implementations]({% post_url 2023-08-22-or1k-fpu-hw %})
 - Linux Kernel support
 - GCC Instructions and Soft FPU
 - Binutils/GDB Debugging Support
 - glibc support

Have a look at previous articles to see what up.  In this article we will cover
updates done to the linux kernel, GCC (done long ago) and GDB for debugging.

In the [last article]({% post_url 2023-04-25-or1k-fpu-port %}) we introduced the OpenRISC glibc FPU port and the effort
required to get user space FPU support into OpenRISC linux user applications.
We explained how the FPU port is a fullstack project covering:

 - Architecture Specification
 - Simulators and CPU implementations
 - Linux Kernel support
 - GCC Instructions and Soft FPU
 - Binutils/GDB Debugging Support
 - glibc support

In this entry we will cover updating *Simulators and CPU implementations* to support
the architecture changes which are called for as per the previous article.

 - Allowing usermode programs to update the FPCSR register
 - Defining tininess before routing

# Simulator Updates

The main simulator we use is QEMU.  The update was done in my
[OpenRISC user space FPCSR](https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20230511151000.381911-1-shorne@gmail.com)
qemu patch series.  The series was merged for the
[qemu 8.1](https://wiki.qemu.org/ChangeLog/8.1) release.

The updates were pretty straight forward and I split it into three changes:
 - Allowing FPCSR access in user mode.
 - Properly set the exception PC address on floating point exceptions.
 - Configuring the QEMU softfloat implementation to perform tininess check
   before rounding.

The first patch to *allow FPCSR access in user mode* was trivial, but required some
code structure changes making the patch look bigger than it really was.

The next patch to *properly set the exception PC address* fixed a long existing
bug where the `EPCR` was not properly updated after FPU exceptions.  Up until now
OpenRISC userspace did not support FPU instructions and this code path had not
been tested.

To explain why this fix is important let us look at the `EPCR` and what it is used for
in a bit more detail.
In general, when an exception occurs an OpenRISC CPU will store the program counter (`PC`)
of the instruction that caused the exception into the exeption program counter address
(`EPCR`).  Floating point exceptions are a special case in that the `EPCR` is
actually set to the next instruction to be executed, this is to avoid looping.

When the linux kernel handles a floating point exception it follows the path
[0xd00][1] > [fpe_trap_handler][2] > [ do_fpe_trap][3].  This will setup a
[signal][4] to be delivered to the user process.
The Linux OS uses the `EPCR` to report the exception instruction address to
userspace via a `signal` which we can see being done in `do_fpe_trap` which
we can see below:

```c
asmlinkage void do_fpe_trap(struct pt_regs *regs, unsigned long address)
{
	int code = FPE_FLTUNK;
	unsigned long fpcsr = regs->fpcsr;

	if (fpcsr & SPR_FPCSR_IVF)
		code = FPE_FLTINV;
	else if (fpcsr & SPR_FPCSR_OVF)
		code = FPE_FLTOVF;
	else if (fpcsr & SPR_FPCSR_UNF)
		code = FPE_FLTUND;
	else if (fpcsr & SPR_FPCSR_DZF)
		code = FPE_FLTDIV;
	else if (fpcsr & SPR_FPCSR_IXF)
		code = FPE_FLTRES;

	/* Clear all flags */
	regs->fpcsr &= ~SPR_FPCSR_ALLF;

	force_sig_fault(SIGFPE, code, (void __user *)regs->pc);
}
```

Here we see the excption becomes a `SIGFPE` signal and the exception address in
`regs->pc` is passed to [force_sig_fault][10].  The `PC` will be used to set the
`si_addr` field of the `siginfo_t` structure.

Next upon return from kernel space to user space the path is `do_fpe_trap` >
`_fpe_trap_handler` > [ret_from_exception][5] > [resume_userspace][6] >
[work_pending][7] > [do_work_pending][8] > [restore_all][9].

Inside of `do_work_pending` with there the signal handling is done.  In explain a bit
about this in the article [Unwinding a Bug - How C++ Exceptions Work]({% post_url 2020-12-13-cxx-exception-unwinding %}).
In `restore_all` we see `EPCR` is returned to when exception handling is
complete. A snipped of this code is show below:

```

    l.lwz   r23,PT_GPR23(r1)                    ;\
    l.lwz   r24,PT_GPR24(r1)                    ;\
    l.lwz   r25,PT_GPR25(r1)                    ;\
    l.lwz   r26,PT_GPR26(r1)                    ;\
    l.lwz   r27,PT_GPR27(r1)                    ;\
    l.lwz   r28,PT_GPR28(r1)                    ;\

    l.lwz   r1,PT_SP(r1)                    ;\
    l.rfe
```

Here we can see how `l.mtspr r0,r3,SPR_EPCR_BASE` restores the `EPCR` to the pc
address stored in `pt_regs` when we entered the exception handler.  All
other register are restored and finally the `l.rfe` instruction is issued to
return from the exception which affectively jumps to `EPCR`.

The reason QEMU was not setting the correct exception address is due to the way
qemu is implemented which optimizes performance.  QEMU executes target code
basic blocks that are translated to host native instructions, during runtime
all `PC` addresses are those of the host, for example x86-64 64-bit
addresses.  When an exception occurs, updating the target `PC` address from the host `PC`
need to be explicityly requested.

[QEMU Translation Internals](https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devel/tcg.html)

The next patch to implement *tininess before rouding* was also trivial but
brought up a conversation about default NaN payloads.

# RTL Updates

The RTL updates look as follows

User mode support.

```

    Make FPCSR is R/W accessible for both user- and supervisor- modes.

The change to verilog shows that before when writng (`spr_we`) to the FPCSR (`OR1K_SPR_FPCSR_ADDR`) register
we used to check that the supervisor bit (`OR1K_SPR_SR_SM`) bit of the sr spr (`spr_sr`) is set.  That check
enforced supervisor mode only write access, removing this allows user space to write to the regsiter.

This implementation already allowed read access.

Updating for tininess was done in 2 of our main OpenRISC cores in the following
patches.

 - mor1kx          - [f2a78cc5d98](https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx/commit/f2a78cc5d98123e63af4b23296795d95ffdfd854)

I will not go into details of these patches as I didnt write them.  But I
general they are medium size refactorings of the floating point unit.
